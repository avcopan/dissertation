\section{One-Electron States}

Hydrogen or silver or alkali metals
\begin{equation}
    (\hat{h} + \hat{v}_\mathrm{e})
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \epsilon
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{h}
    =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    \hat{\mathbf{p}}^2
    +
    \hat{v}_\mathrm{n}
    \qquad
    \hat{v}_\mathrm{n}
    =
    \sum_a^{\mathrm{nuclei}}
    \frac{q_a}{|\mathbf{r}_a-\hat{\mathbf{r}}|}
\end{equation}

Symmetry properties of the potential give us spatial symmetries
\begin{equation}
    \hat{o}
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    o
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}
point groups and lattice groups.
For one electron atoms the O(3) symmetries are described by the conservation of
angular momentum, \(\hat{\mathbf{j}}^2\) and \(\hat{j}_z\).

Goudsmit-Uhlenbeck (Uhlenbeck:1926p264) give us spin, which is a constant intrinsic to the electron
as a particle
\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}^2
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \tfrac{3}{4}
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}

The earlier Stern-Gerlach experiment (Gerlach:1922p349) showed in hindsight that
spin can be oriented up or down along a given axis
\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}_z
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \pm
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}_z
    =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    (
        |\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha|
        -
        |\beta\rangle\langle\beta|
    )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}
    =
    L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)
    \otimes
    \mathrm{SU}(2)
\end{equation}


\section{Many-Electron States}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}
    =
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \hat{h}(i)
    +
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \sum_{j=i+1}^n
    \hat{g}(i,j)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}(i,j)
    =
    \frac{1}{|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_j|}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}^n
    =
    \mathcal{H}(1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathcal{H}(n)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    |\Psi\rangle
    =
    \sum_{p_1\cdots p_n}
    c_{p_1\cdots p_n}
    |\psi_{p_1}\rangle
    \otimes
    \cdots
    \otimes
    |\psi_{p_n}\rangle
\end{equation}


Two problems led to particle stats: the anomalous Zeeman effect, and the absence
of electron {\itshape bunching}.
In an orbital picture, you would expect all of the electrons to fall in the
lowest energy state, such that the ground state is qualitatively described by a
product
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_0(1,\ldots,n)
    \approx
    \psi_0(1)
    \cdots
    \psi_0(n)
\end{equation}
which is indeed what you find for bosons.

Paul describing spin before people knew what it was (Pauli:1925p373):
``The closed energy configurations contribute nothing to the magnetic moment or
angular momentum of the atom.
In particular, in alkali metals the angular momentum values of the atom and its
energy changes in the presence of an external magnetic field are appropriately
interpreted as the sole working of the optically active electron, and the same
situation is thought to be the case in the observations of the anomalous Zeeman
effect.
From this standpoint, the doublet structure of the alkali spectra, as well as
the breakdown of Larmor's theorem, must therefore come from some intrinsic,
classically non-describable type of two-valuedness that is a characteristic of
the optically active electron's state.''
Pauli proposed this without proposing any model for this extra degree of
freedom.
That was the contribution of Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit in 1926.


Pauli exlusion (Pauli:1925p756):
``By considering the case of strong magnetic fields we can reduce [E.~C.]
Stoner's result, that the number of electrons in a completed subgroup [of an
atom] is the same as the number of the corresponding terms of the Zeeman effect
of the alkali spectra, to the following more general rule about the occurrence
of equivalent electrons in an atom:
{\itshape
    There can never be two or more equivalent electrons in an atom for which in
    strong fields the values of all quantum numbers \(n, k_1, k_2, m_1\) (or,
    equivalently \(n, k_1, m_1, m_2\)) are  the same.
    If an electron is present in the atom for which these quantum numbers (in an
    external field) have definite values, this state is ``occupied.''%
}
\dots We cannot give a further justification for this rule, but it seems to be a
very plausible one.
It refers, as mentioned, first of all to the case of strong field.
However, from thermodynamic arguments (the invariance of statistic weights under
adiabatic transformations of the system) it follows that the number of
stationary states of an atom must be the same in strong and weak fields for
given values of the number \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) of the separate electrons and a
value of \(\overline{m_1}=\sum m_1\) for the whole atom.''

This is in contrast to photons in stimulated emission, wehre they are all forced
to occupy the same state.
