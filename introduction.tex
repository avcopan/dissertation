\section{Electronic Structure Theory}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        As an in-road to electronic structure theory, let us first approach the
        subject na\"ively, forgetting what we know about electrons from the
        standard model of particle physics.
    \item
        From the standpoint of Pauli solving the spectrum of hydrogen with
        Heisenberg's new matrix mechanics (Heisenberg:1925p879) at the end of
        1925,(Pauli:1926p336) chemical matter was described by nimble,
        negatively-charged electrons orbiting heavy, positively-charged nuclei.
    \item
        This theory would be conceptually clarified over the following months by
        Schr\"odinger's development of wave mechanics
        (Schrodinger:1926p361,Schrodinger:1926p489,Schrodinger:1926p734).
    \item
        Schr\"odinger's new theory described the possible states of electrons in
        a molecule as eigenfunctions of the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian,
        oscillating in time with a frequency proportional to their energy.
        \begin{equation}
            \Psi(t)
            =
            \Psi
            e^{-iEt}
            \qquad
            \hat{H}
            \Psi
            =
            E
            \Psi
        \end{equation}
    \item
        Crudely put, this Hamiltonian is derived from its classical counterpart
        by replacing its momentum variables with operators,
        \(
            \hat{\mathbf{p}}_i
            =
            -i
            \nabla_i
        \).
        It can be written as a sum over one- and two-electron terms
        \begin{equation}
            \hat{H}
            =
            \sum_i^\text{electrons}
            \hat{h}_i
            +
            \sum_{i<j}^{\substack{\text{electron}\\\text{pairs}}}
            \hat{g}_{ij}
        \end{equation}
        where the one-electron operator
        \(
            \hat{h}_i
        \)
        describes the kinetic energy of the \(i^\text{th}\) electron and its
        electrostatic attraction to the nuclei (Coulomb's law), and the
        two-electron operator
        \(
            \hat{g}_{ij}
        \)
        describes the Coulombic repulsion between two electrons.
        \begin{equation}
            \hat{h}_i
            \equiv
            \tfrac{1}{2}
            \hat{\mathbf{p}}_i^2
            -
            \sum_A^\text{nuclei}
            \frac{Z_A}{|\mathbf{r}_A - \mathbf{r}_i|}
            \qquad
            \hat{g}_{ij}
            \equiv
            \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|}
        \end{equation}
    \item
        The vector space containing the eigenfunctions of a given Hamiltonian is
        the Hilbert space, \(\mathcal{H}\), which in this case is the space of
        square integrable functions of \(n\) position variables,
        \(
            L^2(\mathbb{R}^{3n})
        \),
        one for each electron in the molecule.
    \item
        Since this space is infinite-dimensional, the only way to make progress
        in most cases is to determine a basis that approximately spans the
        states of interest.
    \item
        We are helped in this regard by the fact that a function of \(n\)
        position variables can always be written as a linear combination of
        products
        \begin{equation}
            \Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}_n)
            =
            \sum_{p_1\cdots p_n}
            c_{p_1\cdots p_n}
            \phi_{p_1}(\mathbf{r}_1)
            \cdots
            \phi_{p_n}(\mathbf{r}_n)
        \end{equation}
        where the one-electron functions or {\itshape orbitals} in this
        expansion span a one-electron Hilbert space,
        \(
            \mathcal{H}_1
            =
            L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)
        \).
    \item
        More generally, the Hilbert space of system is always given by a tensor
        product of the Hilbert spaces for its constituent particles.
        \begin{equation}
            \mathcal{H}
            =
            \mathcal{H}_1
            \otimes
            \mathcal{H}_1
            \otimes
            \cdots
        \end{equation}
    \item
        This gives us a route for boot-strapping the electronic structure
        problem:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
                The states of a single electron orbiting a single nucleus are
                analytically known products of Laguerre polynomials and
                spherical Harmonics, and the energy of these 1s, 2s, 2p, \dots
                states increases with the number of nodes.
            \item
                Treating the other electrons in a molecule as a fields which
                partly shield the nuclear charges, the one-electron states of a
                molecule are well described as linear combinations of atomic
                one-electron functions centered on each atom.
            \item
                The dominant contributions to these {\itshape molecular
                orbitals} come from atomic orbitals with a similar energy, so
                that the lowest energy molecular orbital typically looks like
                the 1s orbital of the nucleus with the highest charge, with very
                little contribution from, say, the 48g orbital of another atom.
            \item
                Finally, the total electronic wavefunction is described by a
                linear combination of products of these molecular orbitals, and
                the electronic ground-state will be spanned to a good
                approximation by products of the low-energy molecular orbitals.

The general strategy of many-body quantum mechanics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        Determine the Hilbert spaces for the individual particles in your
        system, ideally by solving an effective one-body problem for the
        stationary states.
    \item
        The Hilbert space for the many-body system is the tensor-product of
        one-particle Hilbert spaces, i.e.~the many-body states are spanned by
        all possible products of one-particle states.
    \item
        Solve for the many-body wavefunction in the basis one or more of these
        product functions.
        If the particles are approximately decoupled, and the one-body basis is
        carefully chosen, one may be able to describe the wavefunction to a good
        approximation using only one or a few product functions.
    \item
        If one or more particles are highly coupled, one may need to include
        larger expansions, such as all possible combinations of states in a
        given energy range, in order to achieve even qualitative accuracy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{One-Electron States}

Hydrogen or silver or alkali metals
\begin{equation}
    (\hat{h} + \hat{v}_\mathrm{e})
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \epsilon
    |\psi\rangle
    \qquad
    \hat{h}
    =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    \hat{\mathbf{p}}^2
    +
    \hat{v}_\mathrm{n}
    \qquad
    \hat{v}_\mathrm{n}
    =
    \sum_a^{\mathrm{nuclei}}
    \frac{q_a}{|\mathbf{r}_a-\hat{\mathbf{r}}|}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}
    =
    L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)
\end{equation}
Assume the motion of the nuclei is infinitely slow on the time-scale of
electronic motion (Born-Oppenheimer approximation).\\
Assume the electron only sees an average field describing the shielding due to
the other electrons (mean-field approximation).

\subsection{Symmetry}

Symmetry properties of the potential give us spatial symmetries
\begin{equation}
    \hat{o}
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    o
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}
point groups and lattice groups.
For one electron atoms the O(3) symmetries are described by the conservation of
angular momentum, \(\hat{\mathbf{j}}^2\) and \(\hat{j}_z\).

\noindent
Atoms: angular momentum (s, p, d)

\noindent
Free electrons: plane waves

\noindent
Molecules and crystals are described by symmetry adapted combinations of these
functions

\subsection{Naive \(n\)-Electron States and the Mean Field}
The mean field of the electrons could be derived by analyzing the full
Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}
    |\Psi\rangle
    =
    E
    |\Psi\rangle
    \qquad
    \hat{H}_1
    =
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \hat{h}_i
    +
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \sum_{j=i+1}^n
    \hat{g}_{ij}
    \qquad
    \hat{g}_{ij}
    =
    \frac{1}{|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_j|}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}_n
    =
    \mathcal{H}_1
    \otimes
    \cdots
    \otimes
    \mathcal{H}_1
\end{equation}

Mean field is described by assuming statistically independent electrons.

Discuss how symmetries combine for the \(n\)-electron state.

\section{Spin and Pauli Exclusion}

Goudsmit-Uhlenbeck (Uhlenbeck:1926p264) give us spin, which is a constant intrinsic to the electron
as a particle
\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}^2
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \tfrac{3}{4}
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}

The earlier Stern-Gerlach experiment (Gerlach:1922p349) showed in hindsight that
spin can be oriented up or down along a given axis
\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}_z
    |\psi\rangle
    =
    \pm
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    |\psi\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{s}_z
    =
    \tfrac{1}{2}
    (
        |\alpha\rangle\langle\alpha|
        -
        |\beta\rangle\langle\beta|
    )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}
    =
    L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)
    \otimes
    \mathrm{SU}(2)
\end{equation}


Two problems led to particle stats: the anomalous Zeeman effect, and the absence
of electron {\itshape bunching}.
In an orbital picture, you would expect all of the electrons to fall in the
lowest energy state, such that the ground state is qualitatively described by a
product
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_0(1,\ldots,n)
    \approx
    \psi_0(1)
    \cdots
    \psi_0(n)
\end{equation}
which is indeed what you find for bosons.

Paul describing spin before people knew what it was (Pauli:1925p373):
``The closed energy configurations contribute nothing to the magnetic moment or
angular momentum of the atom.
In particular, in alkali metals the angular momentum values of the atom and its
energy changes in the presence of an external magnetic field are appropriately
interpreted as the sole working of the optically active electron, and the same
situation is thought to be the case in the observations of the anomalous Zeeman
effect.
From this standpoint, the doublet structure of the alkali spectra, as well as
the breakdown of Larmor's theorem, must therefore come from some intrinsic,
classically non-describable type of two-valuedness that is a characteristic of
the optically active electron's state.''
Pauli proposed this without proposing any model for this extra degree of
freedom.
That was the contribution of Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit in 1926.


Pauli exlusion (Pauli:1925p756):
``By considering the case of strong magnetic fields we can reduce [E.~C.]
Stoner's result, that the number of electrons in a completed subgroup [of an
atom] is the same as the number of the corresponding terms of the Zeeman effect
of the alkali spectra, to the following more general rule about the occurrence
of equivalent electrons in an atom:
{\itshape
    There can never be two or more equivalent electrons in an atom for which in
    strong fields the values of all quantum numbers \(n, k_1, k_2, m_1\) (or,
    equivalently \(n, k_1, m_1, m_2\)) are  the same.
    If an electron is present in the atom for which these quantum numbers (in an
    external field) have definite values, this state is ``occupied.''%
}
\dots We cannot give a further justification for this rule, but it seems to be a
very plausible one.
It refers, as mentioned, first of all to the case of strong field.
However, from thermodynamic arguments (the invariance of statistic weights under
adiabatic transformations of the system) it follows that the number of
stationary states of an atom must be the same in strong and weak fields for
given values of the number \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) of the separate electrons and a
value of \(\overline{m_1}=\sum m_1\) for the whole atom.''

This is in contrast to photons in stimulated emission, where they are all forced
to occupy the same state.

\subsection{Antisymmetry}

Heisenberg to Pauli (May 5, 1926) on the connection between Pauli exclusion and
the singlet triplet gap in helium (Mehra:1982):
{\itshape
    I want to write to you that I have found a rather decisive argument that
    your exclusion of equivalent orbitals is connected with the singlet-triplet
    separation [in helium].
}

Heisenberg to Born (May 26, 1926) on the challenge of calculating the energy
states of helium (Mehra:1982):
{\itshape
    The large separation between the singlet and triplet systems could not be
    explained by a magnetic interaction of the spinning electrons; one had
    therefore to assume with Hund a large force of unknown origin between the
    magnets [Hund's rule].
}
\\
He explains everything by qualitative arguments in his paper on ``The Many-Body
Problem and Resonance in Quantum Mechanics'' (Heisenberg:1926p411), which
{\itshape
    aims to lay the groundwork for a quantum-mechanical treatment of the
    many-body problem.
}
\\
He is the first to propose the form of the Slater determinant.
\begin{equation}
    \Phi
    =
    \sum_{\pi\in\mathrm{S}_n}
    (-)^\pi
    \phi_(\pi(1))
    \cdots
    \phi_n(\pi(n))
\end{equation}



\section{Fock Space}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{H}
    =
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \hat{h}(i)
    +
    \sum_{i=1}^n
    \sum_{j=i+1}^n
    \hat{g}(i,j)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \hat{g}(i,j)
    =
    \frac{1}{|\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_j|}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H}^n
    =
    \mathcal{H}(1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathcal{H}(n)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    |\Psi\rangle
    =
    \sum_{p_1\cdots p_n}
    c_{p_1\cdots p_n}
    |\psi_{p_1}\rangle
    \otimes
    \cdots
    \otimes
    |\psi_{p_n}\rangle
\end{equation}
